        Sarp is a successful police academy student who strives to be a detective. His family has a dark past. His father was in the mafia and went to jail when Sarp was a child. 
        His 3 year-old brother Umut is then kidnapped. Not knowing that they are brothers, they now know each other from the police academy and they do not get along.
        Sarp ends up in jail for a year because of a secret plan made by the police chief Yusuf.
        Umut is now Mert, remembering nothing about his past before the kidnapping. He is close to the mafia Celal and his adopted daughter Melek.
